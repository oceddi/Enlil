This library can be used to animate arbitrary images contained in sprite sheets.  This could be used as a component
in an HTML5 game or for whatever sprite animation project you choose.

Current Feature Set:

- Parse sprite sheets into groupings of animations (i.e. walk, run, fly, jump, etc).
- Cycle through various groupings durin draw calls.
- Movement can be controlled directly by setting screen coordinates or movement paths can be pre-defined and and
  interpolated path can queried at varying time intervals.
